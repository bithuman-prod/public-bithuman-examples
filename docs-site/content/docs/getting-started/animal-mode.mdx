## Automatic Face Detection

The AI system automatically locates the character's face and body in animal images, enabling natural movement and expression mapping.

**What works automatically:**
- Eye tracking for natural gaze
- Mouth detection for speech sync
- Expression mapping for emotions
- Facial landmarks for precise animation

## Manual Face Marking

When the AI cannot locate facial features automatically, you will be prompted to manually mark key points.

Draw a rectangle that encompasses the entire facial area, covering eyes, nose, mouth, and chin.

## Best Practices

**For Optimal Results:**
- Clear facial features — ensure eyes, nose, mouth are visible
- Front-facing pose — straight-on view works best
- Good contrast — features should stand out from background
- High resolution — more detail means better detection

**Tips:**
- Start with the pre-selected animals for guaranteed compatibility
- Use well-lit, high-contrast images
- Be patient with manual marking — precision improves results
- Test with simple expressions first
