## Media Priority System

Understanding how different uploads influence and overwrite each other:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "User Uploads"
        A[Prompt<br/><i>Character Description</i>]
        B[Image<br/><i>Face/Appearance</i>]
        C[Video<br/><i>Face + Movement</i>]
        D[Voice<br/><i>Speech Audio</i>]
    end

    subgraph "Likeness Generation"
        E{Video<br/>Uploaded?}
        E -->|Yes| F[Video OVERWRITES Image<br/>Uses video for likeness]
        E -->|No| G{Image<br/>Uploaded?}
        G -->|Yes| H[Image for Likeness<br/>Auto-generates persona<br/><i>Prompt becomes optional</i>]
        G -->|No| I[Prompt-Only<br/>Generates appearance<br/>from description]
    end

    subgraph "Voice Generation"
        J{Voice<br/>Uploaded?}
        J -->|Yes| K[Uses Uploaded Voice<br/>Clones speech patterns]
        J -->|No| L[Auto-Generated Voice<br/>Matches persona/appearance]
    end

    subgraph "Final Result"
        M[Complete Avatar<br/>Likeness + Voice + Personality]
    end

    A --> E
    B --> E
    C --> E

    F --> J
    H --> J
    I --> J

    K --> M
    L --> M
```

### Key Priority Rules

1. **Video > Image** — Video always overwrites image for likeness
2. **Image = Auto-Prompt** — Images auto-generate persona, making manual prompts optional
3. **Voice** — When uploaded, replaces auto-generated voice
4. **Prompt** — Required only when no image/video provided

### Upload Combinations

| Combination | What Happens |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Prompt Only** | Generates likeness, voice, and movement from text description |
| **Image Only** | Uses image for likeness, auto-generates persona and voice |
| **Voice + Image** | Image for likeness, voice for speech patterns |
| **Video + Voice + Prompt** | Full character control — video for likeness, voice for speech, prompt for personality |

---

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Start simple.** Upload an image for instant results, or use prompts for creative characters. You can always add voice or refine later.
</Tip>

**Recommended Approaches:**

- **Prompts Only** — Good for creative/fictional characters
- **Image Only** — Instant avatar from photo (no prompt needed)
- **Image + Voice** — Realistic character recreation

**Common Issues and Fixes:**

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Poor lighting in images/videos | Use photo editing to improve lighting |
| Background noise in audio | Record audio in quiet spaces |
| Multiple people in frame | Crop images to show only target person |
| Excessive movement in videos | Keep movements subtle and natural |
